# bark-parks-server
This is a repo for the server side of Bark-Parks, it is not intended to work alone, although you can run it by running npm i and npm run dev.
you can try the whole project here https://bark-parks.netlify.app/
or the whole code on this repo
https://github.com/juanmata42/Bark-Parks


If you are wondering why the repo was splitted, it's because I wanted to learn how to deploy on netlify and heroku and make them work together
have fun with your doggo!
